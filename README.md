# bash-install-android-sdk-auto-app-create-on-cloud9
using bash to automate the Android-SDK install specific to cloud9 and then create a debug Hello-Worled App and Access webpage

Jan 24, 2016


Use cloud 9 https://c9.io to istall this repository then run setup.sh

bash setup.sh

(I just right click setup.sh and select run)

The bash file should:
1. install java dependencies
2. install android sdk 4.4
3. install gradle
4. create and App
5. ant or gradle build the app


Then load a webpage that gives your phone access to the app for testing (emulators suck!)

1. index.html right click and select run

1. menu preview - preview running application

1. set your Android 4.4 phone to the URL

1. set your phone security to unknown sources

1.install app





Note: unless you set a version number you may have to fully delete the App to be able to install it again.
